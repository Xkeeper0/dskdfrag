ludum dare theme: "running out of space" (or whatever)
assumed most people are going to: take this as physical space issues
comedy thought ideas: exploration game where the ending is you just run out of stuff to do, rip

current idea (you are here):
"disk defrag". your disk sucks and it's got files everywhere, so you need to clean it up so you can install whatever the latest thing is, probably

main feature:
- file list (right side), maybe show which ones are still yet to do
- grid of clusters on left, with colors corresponding to status
- some clusters may be duplicated or not used by any actual file, free space if you find them
- 'work area' space that has room for a few clusters - freecell-style temporary area
- have to arrange stuff in the work area before copying it back - can't overwrite anything that isn't moved yet
- no time limit or pressure - very much a 'do it in the background if you want' type game
- goal: make a large enough continguous free space area

bonus features:
- ability to pick different sizes of games
- ability to drag finished stuff around to make more room
- input seed for a fixed game, maybe have goofy time trials
- ability to use keyboard + mouse input; name clusters after keyboard keys?

   some file.txt
   [A] [7] [J] [0] [P]
   (push a, 7, j to automatically copy those to the first work area available)
   (would make it sort of like a goofy typing game and be faster than mouse)

- hovering over clusters/files should highlight their components in the grid
- can find fake not-used clusters by going over the entire file list and seeing what doesn't light up
- ?

ui ideas:
- i could hook up the old hard drive and use that, or just record the salt/pepper grinders for disk access
- faux windows 98 cloudy background or something for startup
- other crap
